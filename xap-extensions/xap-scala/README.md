# XAP Scala
Extensions to the XAP API that provide a more natural way of combining Scala with XAP.

## Requirements
- The Scala version required in order to use the XAP Scala extension is 2.11.x - up to 2.11.6.
- Assuming there is a Scala installation under `$SCALA_HOME`, the jars under `$SCALA_HOME/lib` should be copied to `$GS_HOME/lib/optional/scala/lib`
- These jars are referenced by the scala shell (under `$GS_HOME/tools/scala/shell.{bat,sh}`)

## Packaging
- `xap-scala.jar` is located under `$GS_HOME/lib/optional/scala`


See XAP's Scala documentation for more information
